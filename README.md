# diffusion-for-stars
Removes background stars from astronomical images using a diffusion-based method.

This program was written by Maureen Cohen in the course of a Master of Physics research project at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, under the supervision of Dr Weiping Lu.

It is a proof-of-concept tested on 200x200 synthetic and natural astronomical images.
